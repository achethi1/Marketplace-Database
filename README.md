# Marketplace-Database

Phase 1 and 2 pdfs were part of a group project to outline different documentation including ER diagrams, processing needs, and relational schemas to communicate database structure based on the needs of stakeholders.

The various SQL files were independently written to create tables, organize entries, query based on prompts, drop tables, and create text files with relevant information. The file "output.txt" shows the results from creating the text file.

This project was for a database management class to get first hand experience writing SQL scripts and organizing databases to best suit stakeholders.
